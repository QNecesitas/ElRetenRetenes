# ElRetenRetenes
Oil seal sales application. This functioned as a management system for the employees of the ElReten company. 

It was created with Kotlin, using the Model-View-ViewModel pattern in a simple way because it is a small application and internal database with Room. Other JetpackCompose libraries are also used. 

The application was discontinued due to a change in customer activity and sharing its source code is no longer a privacy risk for the customer.
